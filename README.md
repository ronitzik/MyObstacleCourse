# Obstacle Course Game in Unity
This repository contains the Unity project for an Obstacle Course game I developed. The game is designed to test players' navigation skills through a challenging environment filled with various obstacles.


## Game Overview
The Obstacle Course is a 3D game where the player must maneuver through a series of walls, ramps, spinners, and other obstacles to reach the finish line. The course is designed to be progressively more challenging, requiring control and quick reflexes to avoid hitting obstacles.

### Key Features:
Diverse Obstacles: The course includes various types of obstacles such as walls, ramps, spinners, and droppers that players must navigate around or over.

Progressive Difficulty: The level design progressively increases in difficulty, challenging the playerâ€™s skill and timing.

Collision Detection: The game features a collision detection system that logs when the player bumps into obstacles, adding to the challenge and fun of the game.

### How to Play:
Use the controls to navigate the player character through the course.

Avoid colliding with obstacles to maintain your speed and reach the finish line as quickly as possible.

The number of collisions is tracked and displayed in the console for debugging purposes.
